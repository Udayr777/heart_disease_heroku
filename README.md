# heart_disease_heroku

I initiated my foray into cloud deployment by elevating a Machine Learning project focused on predicting heart disease using the Linear Regression algorithm. Harnessing the robust Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle, I navigated its complexities to extract valuable insights.

At the project's core, I meticulously deployed the Linear Regression algorithm, refining it for optimal predictive accuracy. Rigorous evaluation using the mean square error metric ensured precise forecasting of heart disease occurrences. A key outcome was encapsulating the trained model into the modele.pkl pickle file, facilitating future deployment and utilization.

To democratize the model's predictive capabilities, I expanded its reach through an intuitive web interface. The resulting user-friendly web page, named index.html, provided an interactive platform for users to seamlessly engage with the predictive model. Users could input relevant data and receive instant predictions on the likelihood of heart disease.

The integration of Flask API played a pivotal role in establishing a robust connection between the web page and the Heroku cloud server. Leveraging both GET and POST requests, I facilitated seamless communication, ensuring user inputs were effectively transmitted to the underlying model for real-time predictions. This not only enhanced the user experience but also demonstrated my proficiency in building dynamic and responsive applications.

In summary, this project represents a significant milestone, showcasing my ability to conceptualize, develop, and deploy end-to-end machine-learning solutions with a keen focus on usability and practicality. You can view the deployed project at https://heart-disease-d8a6e58a4676.herokuapp.com/.
